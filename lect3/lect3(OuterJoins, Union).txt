LEFT OUTER JOIN:
    Return everything from LEFT table, even if it's not present in RIGHT
    No need to use LEFT OUTER JOIN, same as INNER JOIN => JOIN.
    LEFT OUTER JOIN => LEFT JOIN.
examples:
    SELECT
    film.film_id, film.title,
    inventory.inventory_id
    FROM film
    LEFT OUTER JOIN inventory ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id;
    ^^Film_IDs and titles by present in inventory by id.

    SELECT
    film.film_id, film.title,
    inventory.inventory_id
    FROM film
    LEFT OUTER JOIN inventory ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
    WHERE inventory.film_id IS NULL;
    ^^Film_IDs and titles not presented in inventory by id.

UNION operator:
    UNION ALL -> to add duplicated rows.
    The UNION operator combines result sets of two or more SELECT statements
    into a single result set.
        SELECT column1, column2
        FROM table1
        UNION
        SELECT column1, column2
        FROM table2
        ^^Giving us single output of all 4 columns from 2 different tables combined.
    The following are rules applied to the queries:
        - Both queries must return the same number of columns.
        - The corresponding columns in the queries must have compatible data types.
     The UNION operator removes all duplicate rows unless the UNION ALL is used.
     The UNION operator may place the rows in the first query before, after or between
    the rows in the result set of the second query.
     To sort the rows in the combined result set by a specified column, you use the
    ORDER BY clause.
