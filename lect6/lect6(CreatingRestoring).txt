All of that already been done with pgAdmin4.
But I skipped part with just Query commands to restore/create db.

1) Go to a working directory \PostgreSQL\15\bin , folder with PostgreSQL executables.
   There's a lot of executable from create/restore to w.e other function I still don't know.
2) Create database.

    run -> .\createdb -U postgres dvdrental
        -U -> username
        --help to get all commands ;)

3) Restore schemas/data:
    run -> .\pg_restore -U postgres -d dvdrental C:\Users\Pampam\PycharmProjects\SQL-Bootcamp\lect1\dvdrental.tar
        -U -> Username
        -d -> database to restore
        full path to .tar to restore from
    only schema ->
    -> .\pg_restore -s -U postgres -d dvdrental C:\Users\Pampam\PycharmProjects\SQL-Bootcamp\lect1\dvdrental.tar

All of it can be done through pgAdmin, faster and more accessible.
But still need to practice with command_lines, especially for a server actions.
