VIEWS:
    A vies is a database object that is of a stored query.
    A vies can be accessible as a virtual table in PostgreSQL.
    In other words, a PostgreSQL vies is a logical table that represents data of one
     or more underlying tables through a SELECT statement.
    A view helps simplify the complexity of a query because you can query a view, which is based
     on a complex query, using a simple SELECT statement.
    Like a table, you can grant permission to users through a view that contains specific
     data that the users are authorized to see.
    A view provides a consistent layer even the columns of underlying table changes.
    To create a view:

        CREATE VIEW view_name AS query;

example:
    CREATE VIEW customer_info AS
    SELECT first_name, last_name, email, address, phone
    FROM customer
    JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id;

    SELECT *
    FROM customer_info;
    ^^Now we can access all of that by VIEW, show correct data from these tables not just screenshot.

    ALTER VIEW customer_info
    RENAME TO customer_master_list;
    ^^We can rename.

    ALTER VIEW customer_master_list
    RENAME COLUMN first_name TO first_name_test;
    ^^Rename can be used same as in any table, but it didn't change table naming/data.

    DROP VIEW IF EXISTS customer_master_list;
    ^^Deleting.
