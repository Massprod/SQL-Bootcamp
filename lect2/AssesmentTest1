COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING TASKS!
------------
#1
Return the customer IDs of customers who have spent at least $110
with the staff member who has an ID of 2.
! The answer should be customers 187 and 148. !

!
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id, staff_id
HAVING SUM(amount) >= 110 AND staff_id = 2;
! Or it's better to filter before GROUP BY with WHERE to simplify ->
-> !
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM payment
WHERE staff_id = 2
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) >= 110;
! Same result.

Course solution:
SELECT customer_id,SUM(amount)

FROM payment

WHERE staff_id = 2

GROUP BY customer_id

HAVING SUM(amount) > 110;

#2
How many films begin with the letter J?
! The answer should be 20. !

!
SELECT COUNT(title)
FROM film
WHERE title LIKE 'J%';
! Just showing count of correct options.

Course solution:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film

WHERE title LIKE 'J%';
^^Only difference with my solution, that I don't use all columns.
  Dont know why their prefer to use all columns, but if we need to filter JUST ONE
  why bother to take everything? In related databases there's always full rows, with
  only some columns nulled, and if we need to filter only BY ONE why take all?
  W.e both work, I will stick to mine.

What customer has the highest customer ID number whose name starts with an 'E'
and has an address ID lower than 500?
! The answer is Eddie Tomlin !

!
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customer
WHERE address_id < 500 AND first_name LIKE 'E%'
ORDER BY customer_id DESC
LIMIT 1;
! With using GROUP BY ->
-> !
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customer
WHERE address_id < 500
GROUP BY first_name, last_name, customer_id
HAVING first_name LIKE 'E%'
ORDER BY customer_id DESC
LIMIT 1;
! Same result.

Course solution:
SELECT first_name,last_name FROM customer

WHERE first_name LIKE 'E%'

AND address_id <500

ORDER BY customer_id DESC

LIMIT 1;
^^Same solution as mine but I made extra GROUP BY option.
