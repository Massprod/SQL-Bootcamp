CREATE TABLE:
    To create a new table in PostgreSQL, you use the CREATE TABLE statement:
        CREATE TABLE table_name
        (
        column_name DATA_TYPE column_constraint,
        table_constraint
        )
        INHERITS existing_table_name;

        column_constraint -> defines the rules for the column e.g., NOT NULL, NULL, UNIQUE.
        table_constraint -> defines rules for the data in the table.
        INHERITS -> specify an existing table from which the new table inherits. It means the new table
                    contains all columns of the existing table and the columns defined in the CREATE TABLE statement.

BASIC CONSTRAINTS:
    NOT NULL -> the values of the column cannot be NULL.
    UNIQUE -> the value of the column must be unique across the whole table.
        ^^However, the column can have many NULL values, they are considered UNIQUE in PostgreSQL.
          SQL standard only allows one NULL value in the column that has the UNIQUE constraint.
    PRIMARY KEY -> this constraint is the combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints.
                   You can define one column as PRIMARY KEY by using column-level constraint.
                   In case the primary key contains multiple columns, you must use the table-level.
    CHECK -> enables to check a condition when you insert or update data.
             For example, the values in the price column of the product table must be positive.
    REFERENCES -> constrains the value of the column that exists in a column in another table.
           ^^Defining FOREIGN KEYS.

TABLE CONSTRAINTS:
    UNIQUE(column_list) -> to force the value stored in the columns listed inside the parentheses to be unique.
    PRIMARY KEY(column_list) -> to define the primary key that consists of multiple columns.
    CHECK(condition) -> to check a condition when inserting or updating data.
    REFERENCES -> to constrain the value stored in the column that must exist in a column in another table.

example:
    CREATE TABLE account (
        user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        email VARCHAR(350) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        created_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
        last_login TIMESTAMP
    );

    CREATE TABLE role (
    	role_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	    role_name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL
    );

    CREATE TABLE account_role (
	user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
	role_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
	grant_date TIMESTAMP,
	PRIMARY KEY (user_id, role_id),
	CONSTRAINT account_role_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (role_id)
		REFERENCES role (role_id) MATCH SIMPLE
		ON UPDATE NO ACTION
		ON DELETE NO ACTION,
	CONSTRAINT account_role_user_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (user_id)
		REFERENCES account (user_id) MATCH SIMPLE
		ON UPDATE NO ACTION
		ON DELETE NO ACTION
    );
    ^^Setting foreign keys without updating, deleting on action.

challenge:
    A customer's first name, last name,email,sign-up date, and number of minutes spent on the dvd rental site.
    You should also have some sort of id tracker for them.
    You have free rein on how you want to create this table.
    !
    CREATE TABLE dvd_customers (
        customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        email VARCHAR(250) UNIQUE,
        signed_up TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
        minutes_spent INTEGER
    );
    !
    Correct. <- Only difference is allowing to NULL email, cuz not everyone should have it or give it.
