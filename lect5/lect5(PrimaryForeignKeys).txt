PRIMARY KEY:
    A primary key is a column or a group of columns that is used
     to identify a row uniquely in a table
    You define primary keys through primary key constraints.
    A table can have one and only one primary key.
    When you add a primary key to a table, PostgreSQL creates a unique index on the column
     or a group of columns used to define the primary key.

example:
    CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_name data_type PRIMARY KEY,
    column_name data_type, etc...);
--------------
FOREIGN KEY:
    A foreign key is a field or group of fields in a table that uniquely
     identifies a row in another table.
    In other words, a foreign key is defined in a table that refers
     to the primary_key of another table.
    The table that contains the foreign key is called referencing table or child table.
    And the table to which the foreign key references is called referenced table or parent table.
    A table can have multiple foreign keys depending on its relationships with other tables.

    In PostgreSQL, you define a foreign key through a foreign key constraint.
    A foreign key constraint indicates that values in a column or a group of columns in the
     child table match with values in a column or a group of columns of the parent table.
    We say that a foreign key constraint maintains referential integrity between child and
     parent tables.
